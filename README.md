## Objective

The overall objective of this project is to be able to differentiate different sounds in audio files. In the end we want to be able to detect sounds of bark beetles in trees.

## Pipeline

0. Read Audio Files
1. Audio Data PreProcessing (Filtering?)
2. Audio Processing & Evaluation (üêõ or üö´)
3. Final Decision

## Get Started

- Install [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
- Create Virtual environment with `conda create -n <ENV_NAME> python=3.6`
- Activate venv with `conda activate <ENV_NAME>`
- Install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Removing venv by first deactivataing and then `conda env remove -n <ENV_NAME>`
